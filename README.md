  ## Description:
  - I built this project to provide a user a way to keep notes in a very simple fashion without the use of external programs like OneNote.
  - This web app solves the problem of being forced into paid software for PC note-taking, as well as allowing remote access from a mobile phone.
  - While building this app, I solidified my existing knowledge of express and how to use routes during the building of an API server.
  - This project stands out for its simplicity and functionality, with very little excess and a one-track focus on the notes at hand.

  ## Installation:
  Installing this project is simple. All a user needs to do is navigate to the [deployed web link](https://note-taker-drcallaghan.herokuapp.com/).

  ## Usage:
  With this app, you can write and save notes, pull up old notes, and delete old notes. See this [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P3SArqxLUNTTWr-JHN_s6vDMb7DvLIDI/view?usp=sharing) if you have any issues using the app.
